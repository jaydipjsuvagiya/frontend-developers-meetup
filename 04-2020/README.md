# FED Meetup Chapter - April 2020

**Point Covered**
* Setup a project from scratch using CLI and Package Manager  

**Tools/Prerequisites for getting started**
* make sure your machine is connected with the Internet :D 
* [Node Js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (LTS version recommended)
* basic understanding of [CLI](https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_cli.asp)
* basic understanding of [package managers](https://blog.idrsolutions.com/2018/07/what-is-a-package-manager-and-why-should-you-use-one/)
    * A package manager is a programming languageâ€™s tool to create project environments and easily import external dependencies.
* [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)
* basic understanding of [package.json](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/nodejs-package-json) file

**Packages used**
* [Jquery](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jquery)
* [Bootstrap](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bootstrap) | [Documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/)
* [Laravel-mix](https://www.npmjs.com/package/laravel-mix) | [Installation Guide](https://laravel-mix.com/docs/5.0/installation)

**Step by step guide to create a project**
* Create a directory/folder and open this in command prompt/terminal (for this you need basic understanding of [CLI](https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_cli.asp) like how to navigate to particular directory)
* Type below command to generate package.json file (this command only work if your machine has [Node/NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed)  ```npm init -y```
*  now you can check in your folder for [package.json](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/nodejs-package-json) file
* now create SRC directory with necessary files(In this directory we will write our development code)  ![src directory](images-for-readme/basic-project-src-directory.png)
* let's add packages listed at top by following commands  ```npm i jquery```  ```npm i bootstrap```  ```npm i laravel-mix```
* now include bootstrap to our app.scss file  ```@import "~bootstrap/scss/bootstrap";```  ![add-bootstrap-to-scss](images-for-readme/add-bootstrap-to-scss-file.png)
* now include jquery and bootstrap js to our app.js file<br/>```require("jquery");  require("bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle");```  
![add jquery and bootstrap js to app.js file](images-for-readme/add-js-to-app-js-file.png) 
* now it's time to generate webpack.mix.js file at root level of our directory(for compiling/bundling our scss and js file to our production folder. you can check [laravel-mix](https://laravel-mix.com/docs/5.0/installation) documentation for more) 
![webpack.mix.js](images-for-readme/webpack-mix.png)    
```
let mix = require('laravel-mix');
mix.js('src/js/app.js', 'public/assets/js/')
   .sass('src/scss/app.scss', 'public/assets/css/');
```
* now add scripts to our package.json file. scripts can be found [here](https://laravel-mix.com/docs/5.0/installation#npm-scripts) (please read the [package.json](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/nodejs-package-json) anatomy if you don't familiar with that)  ![script to package.json](images-for-readme/scripts-to-package-json-file.png)
* now hit this command for handle different environments(mac and windows)```npm install cross-env --save-dev```
* we are done, now just run following command and see the magic :D ```npm run watch```
* now if you check your project directory you should see public folder with your js and css file, so you can use this as you want  ![final folder structure](images-for-readme/final-project-structure.png)

*Please note that all things we discussed/referred is our own way to get work done. this is not recommended/useful in all cases so think about what fits best to you*  

*currently we dont have any social media accounts for this meetup/community so meanwhile you can stay connected with me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/jaydipjsuvagiya), [LinkedIn](https://in.linkedin.com/in/jaydipjsuvagiya), and [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/jaydipjsuvagiya) for further updates for upcoming meetups.*
